# Below are the requirments

# Coding test:

## Requirements:

* Implement a self executable Node program using Javascript, preferrably ES6 syntax.
* The program should read the input file `gpc_list.json` in first, and then read keyboard input from console.
* The program should use Javascript library provided here to build a Tree structure model from the input JSON: http://jnuno.com/tree-model-js/
* The program should use functions provided by TreeModel to first find the node with label matches the keyboard input, then print all the labels of its ancestral nodes and itself.
* Any exception caused by keyboard input should be properly handled.
* Unit tests for the core functionality are required, which use the phrases from `gpc_tree_test_input.json` as the input for label searching, and use the data from `gpc_tree_test_result.json` for verification.
* It is recommended to develop the program incrementally and preserve the Git/ SVN history to showcase your way of thinking during the development.
* An simple instruction of how to run the program and test cases should also be included.
